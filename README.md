# Parser for Hauppauge's MCE Tool
Using Hauppauge products with Windows 7 Media Center doesn't offer access to subchannels by default and is nearly impossible to add for some, such as the Colossus, that are used with set top boxes.  There are tools to add subchannels to Media Center's guide, but the format of the channel number isn't necessarily something that the set top box or third party tools used with Hauppauge's MCE tool can understand.  The aim of this project is to extract the channel number from the output of the MCE tool and display it in a message box for debugging purposes and, if necessary, operate as an intermediary API between the MCE tool and the DirecTV Channel Control serial CLI used to tune DirecTV set top boxes.
